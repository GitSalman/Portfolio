Personal Portfolio (Post-Undergrad)

My name is Salman Iqbal.
I am a recent Indiana University graduate who has completed their BS in Chemistry, 
with minors in math, physics, and computer science.
I enjoy biking, reading Sci-Fi books, and watching kung-fu movies.
I also enjoy Indian, Korean, American, Italian, Mexican, Brazilian, Croatian, Phillipine, 
and Japanese food. I like all food really.
I am a Taekwondo yellow belt master.
Fun fact: I am the worst Magic: The Gathering player in NW Indiana.
